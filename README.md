# Godot-FirstProject
First Project in Godot - Using GDScript and Sunny Land Assets

### With Godot, I've made a few platformer games and learned the main concepts for development with the engine with GD Script, like scene, nodes, docker, signals, groups, and more valuable shortcuts and project organization.
### Here, I learned to use the primary node for Godot development, like Sprite2D, CharacterBody2D, SpriteAnimation, AnimationPlayer, AudioStreamPlayer, Tilemap, Area2D, CollisionShape2D, and many others. I've learned to use the engine Input Action and Input class to get the player's input.
